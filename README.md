Out of Atmosphere CANSAT operation codes for 2025 Thailand Cansat Competition
Some how in (unofficial) collaboration between The Prince Royal's College School and Varee Chiangmai

Although the gliding phase doesn't work (Because it wasn't even initialized!!!**), we did managed to get the data of the entire operation. 
That also includes the cansat steering vector dicisions (which is 100% accurate!!)

Admittedly, the data structure and lora communication are mostly 70% vibe coded, but not for the control algorithms. That was something I 100% written my own.
